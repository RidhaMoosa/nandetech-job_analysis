Closing date: 09 February 2022


BACKGROUND
The illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products has grown exponentially in recent years, largely driven by corruption and weak governance, rising demand in Asia, growing wealth, and expanding trade routes. Wildlife traffickers exploit the increasing connectivity of global transportation and gaps in law enforcement to minimize the risk of detection and undermine the rule of law.

High value goods such as rhino horn are primarily trafficked in air transport. As Africa is home to significant rhino populations, Southern and Eastern African airports are particularly vulnerable to wildlife trafficking and compromised governance due to the risk of corruption.


This project will improve the detection of trafficked products at points of departure through the use of automated detection technology. This project aligns with the South Africa, Kenya, and Namibia government’s efforts to address wildlife trafficking and in particular rhino poaching and horn trafficking as a priority crime. The key enforcement stakeholders in these countries regarding wildlife crime and anti-smuggling will either be directly engaged or coordinated with, depending on their roles and responsibilities.

The overall goal of this project is to reduce the ability of criminal groups to carry out and profit from poaching and trafficking of protected animals and their body parts originating from or transiting Africa.

The DCES division is looking to appoint a PhD Research Intern who has studied and has an interest in the field of human and social sciences particularly in areas of democracy, governance, citizenship, developmental state, peace, human security, and sustainable development.. The Developmental, Capable and Ethical State (DCES) division conducts transdisciplinary, intersectional, policy and programme-relevant research. The two over-arching questions that guide the research interventions are:


How to strengthen democracy through transparent governance, accountable leadership and reinvigorated public participation/ civic engagement; and
How to ensure sustainable development through peace, human and social security

A developmental, capable and ethical state is not possible without ensuring peace and sustainable security within South Africa and beyond its borders. In order to work towards a more socially cohesive citizenry and safer and resilient communities, it is necessary to focus on building a “better South Africa, a better Africa and a better world.”

The Vision of DCES is for it to be a national, regional and international hub for transformative research in the interests of a just and equal society.
